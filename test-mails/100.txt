My honest opinion. It's a very mediocre song. Nothing unique or special  about her music, lyrics or voice. Nothing memorable like Billie Jean or  Beat It. Before her millions of fans reply with hate comments, i know this  is a democracy and people are free to see what they want. But then don't I  have the right to express my opinion? Please don't reply with dumb comments  lie "if you don't like it don't watch it". I just came here to see what's  the buzz about(661 million views??) and didn't like what i saw. OK??
