This song is the most boring, asinine song I have ever heard. Coming from a  guy who liked "Teenage Dream" (the song). Ever since Katy Perry's divorce  it's wave after wave of shitty but successful songs... For those of you  saying "This is the next wave of pop music". Stick it up your ass. Katy  Perry is like Silly Putty. ?
