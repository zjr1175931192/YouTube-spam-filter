I've figured out why I dislike this song: it's supposed to be a power  ballad right? Something that's uplifting and motivating by the end.  However, the final chorus has NO extra UMPH at the end and actually sounds  just like the first one. Instead of crescendo-ing into a powerful finish,  "Roar" just says on the same wavelength. It falls flat.?
