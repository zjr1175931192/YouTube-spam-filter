Hey Guys, I know you tend to skip these comments, but Take a look first.  I am Free Fire, A Big Room, Progressive House, Deep House, Dubstep &amp;  Chillstep Producer from a small town in Missouri. Down here, I have no  support from the community, and all I really ask is some critiquing,  Support, and Views.   My Music has gotten much better then what it was 10 months ago, and I  promise my new content should be more then satisfying. Soon I should be  able to advertise and I wont pester you guys anymore.  So gimme a chance and check out my music, thanks and god bless.?
