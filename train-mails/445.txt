Made five years ago and people still don&#39;t understand the message this song is conveying. For those of you who don&#39;t, understand that domestic violence is no game, women like the fictional one in this video do exist. Living their lives with a man who abuses her, but still chooses to stay for not the love, but for the sexual feeling he gives her. This is quite sad, actually. ?
