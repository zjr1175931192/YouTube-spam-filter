Hey everyone, I&#39;m Dakoda Bigelow.  I&#39;m a 17 year old singer, rapper and producer.  I&#39;ve gained over 490,000 views so far but I really need more views, likes and subscribers in order to make it.  Check out my brand new music video for my song So Gone!  Also check out my new song called Deaf.  A few moments of your time would be greatly appreciated and you won&#39;t regret it :)  Please thumbs this up so more people can see it!  Thanks for the support.
