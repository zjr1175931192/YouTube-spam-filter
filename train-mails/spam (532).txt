This past Christmas my dad passed away, to help me cope I picked up a pen and some paper and started to write. Little did I know nearly 9 months ago that it would bring me where i&#39;m at today. Over 7k subscribers and 500k video views. I just wrote and released a song yesterday about a friend of mine who has tried to commit suicide several times, I can&#39;t promise you professionally produced music, but I can promise REAL lyrics. Just click on my picture. Thanks, and thumbs up so others may see?
