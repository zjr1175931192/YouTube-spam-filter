Hi everyone. We are a duo and we are starting to record freestyles and put them on youtube. If any of you could check it out and like/comment it would mean so much to us because we love doing this. We may not have the best recording equipment but if you listen to our lyrics and rhymes I think you&#39;ll like it. If you do then please subscribe and share because we love making these videos and we want you to like them as much as possible so feel free to comment and give us pointers! Thank you!
