3 yrs ago I had a health scare but thankfully I¡¯m okay. I realized I wasn¡¯t living life to the fullest.  Now I¡¯m on a mission to do EVERYTHING I¡¯ve always wanted to do. If you found out you were going to die tomorrow would you be happy with what you¡¯ve accomplished or would you regret not doing certain things? Sorry for spamming I¡¯m just trying to motivate people to do the things they¡¯ve always wanted to. If you¡¯re bored come see what I¡¯ve done so far! Almost 1000 subscribers and I just started!
