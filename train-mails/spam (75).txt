Hi there~I'm group leader of Angel, a rookie Korean pop group. We have four  members, Chanicka, Julie, Stephanie, and myself, Leah. Please feel free to  check out our channel and leave some feedback on our cover videos (:  criticism is welcome as we know we're not top notch singers so please come  leave some constructive feedback on our videos; we appreciate any chance to  improve before auditioning for a Korean management company. We plan on  auditioning for JYP, BigHit, Jellyfish, YG or SM. Thank you for taking time  out of your day to read this !?
