I hope everyone is in good spirits I&#39;m a hard working student who&#39;s also a passionate singer I look foward to the day when I can make my own music to share But for now I&#39;ve just been doing covers. Check out my channel, I&#39;ve done Covers of Miley Cyrus, Imagine Dragons, Lana Del Rey, Drake, Macklemore, Pink and countless others.  Subscribe only if you want to. My goal isn&#39;t to become famous but to  inspire FYI this isn&#39;t spamming, everyone has a right to freedom of speech. Thanks
